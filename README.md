### Installation


Install [Node.js and npm](https://npmjs.org/), and then use npm to pull any packages.

```
$ npm install
```

#### Deploying to Heroku

First, make sure you've already installed the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart) and setup your heroku instance.
```
$ heroku create your_app_name
```

Then, push to heroku and open the main app in your desktop browser.
```
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku open
```

Finally, point your iPhone to www.your_app_name.heroku.com/shutter.html to setup your trigger. I highly recommend adding the page to your homescreen as a web clip.
